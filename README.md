# pro-clash_royale_api

RoyaleAPI, the unofficial public API for Clash Royale! You can use this API to access Clash Royale API endpoints, which provides real-time information about players, clans, clan wars, tournaments and many more. You can see implementations of this API in Showcase (https://docs.royaleapi.com/#/showcase) by third-party developers and on their web site: https://royaleapi.com

Wrappers (https://docs.royaleapi.com/#/wrappers) in multiple languages are also available.

If you are new to development using REST APIs, I recommend that you try out Postman, which provides many useful tools for your daily development needs.

Employee Management System as a REST Service using Spring Tool Suite 4 as an IDE.

Complex level of a Java Rest Controller Application integrated with well-known library 'mysql-connector-java-8.0.15' to connect to MySQL Database and H2 Database locally.

For all beginners/semi-pro, this is perfect repository to start-off with a java application describing Employee Management System using Rest Controller, MVC Design Pattern and JPA Annotations for validity of incoming REST API calls. I have used MySQL Workbench for managing database. I have added some security features, validations, auto-complete feature for better conduct of this application. I have used Spring Tool Suite 4 as an IDE.

For testing the application, you can use Postman (API Development Environment) to make various calls to the system and start managing the Employees and Managers Details. I have added basic REST API calls for managing the Employee viz. Create, Search, Update and Delete Employee. I have handle all possible exceptions which can occur while making any REST API calls through correct HTTP Status Codes.

I have also generated Swagger documentation for this REST API describing each and every API Operation functionality and also stating HTTP Request and Response type and error message handling part.

NOTE: - If anyone wants to generate Java Client to consume this REST API , go to http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs. Copy Paste content to Swagger Editor and click on Generate Client Tab at top and select Java from dropdown menu. It will download ZIP file.
